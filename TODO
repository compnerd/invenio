## TODO

  - improve alignment of search window on multi-monitor setups
    * shadow is currently split across the monitors
  - see if there is a better way of mapping the ignored modifiers in lash
    * currently assumes that GDK\_MOD2\_MASK is NumLock
  - detect if placed on the bottom panel and rotate search result growth
    direction
  - fix search window behaviour with alt+drag (make the window a GTK\_POPUP\_WINDOW)
  - create destroy functions and save the configuration there
  - monitor configuration file and update on binding changes
  - create a simple GUI preferences dialog
